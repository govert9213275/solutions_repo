Theoretical Foundation 1.1 Introduction Projectile motion is governed by Newton's laws of motion under the influence of a constant gravitational field. In this section, we derive the parametric equations for projectile motion, and express the key characteristics \u2014 time of flight , horizontal range , and maximum height \u2014 in terms of: Initial velocity \\(v_0\\) Projection angle \\(\\theta\\) Gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) Launch height \\(h\\) (optional) We assume the absence of air resistance and a flat horizontal surface unless otherwise stated. 1.2 Deriving the Equations of Motion We decompose the initial velocity \\(v_0\\) into horizontal and vertical components: Horizontal: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos \\theta\\) Vertical: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin \\theta\\) Assuming acceleration due to gravity acts only vertically, the kinematic equations are: Horizontal Motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion: \\[ y(t) = h + v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] These parametric equations describe the complete trajectory: - \\(x(t)\\) : Horizontal displacement at time \\(t\\) - \\(y(t)\\) : Vertical displacement at time \\(t\\) 1.3 Time of Flight (T) Case A: Launched from Ground ( \\(h = 0\\) ) The projectile lands when \\(y(T) = 0\\) . Solve: $$ 0 = v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot T - \\frac{1}{2} g T^2 $$ Factoring out \\(T\\) : $$ T \\left( v_0 \\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g T \\right) = 0 $$ Ignoring the trivial solution \\(T = 0\\) , we get: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} $$ Case B: Launched from Height \\(h > 0\\) Solve \\(y(T) = 0\\) : $$ 0 = h + v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot T - \\frac{1}{2} g T^2 $$ This is a quadratic in \\(T\\) : $$ \\frac{1}{2} g T^2 - v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot T - h = 0 $$ Solving: $$ T = \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin \\theta)^2 + 2 g h}}{g} $$ (Only the positive root is physically valid.) 1.4 Horizontal Range (R) The horizontal range is the total horizontal distance traveled before the projectile lands: \\[ R = x(T) = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot T \\] Using the time of flight expressions above: If \\(h = 0\\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This range is maximized when \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) is maximal, i.e., when \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\Rightarrow \\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . If \\(h > 0\\) : Use: $$ R = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\left( \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin \\theta)^2 + 2 g h}}{g} \\right) $$ 1.5 Maximum Height ( \\(H\\) ) The projectile reaches its maximum height when the vertical velocity becomes zero: \\[ v_y(t_H) = 0 = v_0 \\sin \\theta - g t_H \\] Solving for time to reach maximum height: $$ t_H = \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} $$ Substitute into \\(y(t)\\) : $$ H = h + v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} - \\frac{1}{2} g \\left( \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\right)^2 $$ Simplifies to: $$ H = h + \\frac{(v_0 \\sin \\theta)^2}{2g} $$ 1.6 Assumptions To derive these equations, we made the following assumptions: The gravitational field is uniform: \\(g = 9.81 \\ \\text{m/s}^2\\) . The projectile is treated as a point mass. Air resistance is negligible. The launch and landing surfaces are horizontal and level (unless otherwise stated). The Earth's curvature and rotation are ignored (reasonable for short distances). 2. Analysis of the Range 2.1 Definition The range \\(R\\) of a projectile is defined as the horizontal distance traveled between the launch point and the point of impact (where the projectile returns to the same vertical level, or hits the ground). The range is a function of several parameters: Initial velocity: \\(v_0\\) Projection angle: \\(\\theta\\) Gravitational acceleration: \\(g\\) Launch height: \\(h\\) We express \\(R\\) as a function of the angle \\(\\theta\\) under two scenarios: 2.2 Launch from Ground Level ( \\(h = 0\\) ) From the theoretical derivation: Time of flight: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} $$ Horizontal velocity: \\(v_0 \\cos \\theta\\) Thus, the horizontal range is: $$ R(\\theta) = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Observations: The range is maximum when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , which occurs at: $$ \\theta = 45^\\circ $$ The function \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) is symmetric about \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) : $$ R(30^\\circ) = R(60^\\circ), \\quad R(20^\\circ) = R(70^\\circ) $$ \\(R(\\theta)\\) is a trigonometric function bounded by: $$ 0 \\leq R(\\theta) \\leq \\frac{v_0^2}{g} $$ 2.3 Launch from a Height ( \\(h > 0\\) ) The time of flight becomes: $$ T = \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin \\theta)^2 + 2 g h}}{g} $$ Thus, the range is: $$ R(\\theta) = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\left( \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin \\theta)^2 + 2 g h}}{g} \\right) $$ Key Insights: The expression is no longer symmetric about \\(45^\\circ\\) . As \\(h\\) increases, the projectile stays in the air longer, increasing the range. The angle for maximum range is less than \\(45^\\circ\\) when launched from height. 2.4 Factors Influencing the Range 1. Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) Range is quadratic in \\(v_0\\) : $$ R \\propto v_0^2 $$ Doubling \\(v_0\\) quadruples the range (all else equal). 2. Gravitational Acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) Range is inversely proportional to \\(g\\) : $$ R \\propto \\frac{1}{g} $$ Projectiles travel farther on the Moon (lower \\(g\\) ), and shorter on Jupiter (higher \\(g\\) ). 3. Projection Angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) For ground-level launch: $$ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ \\(R\\) increases with \\(\\theta\\) up to \\(45^\\circ\\) , then decreases. 4. Launch Height ( \\(h\\) ) Higher \\(h\\) \u2192 longer flight time \u2192 greater range. The angle that maximizes range shifts lower as \\(h\\) increases. There is no simple analytical angle that maximizes range in this case \u2014 it must be found numerically. 2.5 Summary At ground level , \\(R(\\theta)\\) is maximized at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . With launch height , maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta < 45^\\circ\\) . Range is sensitive to changes in \\(v_0\\) and \\(h\\) , and inversely sensitive to \\(g\\) . Real-world applications must consider terrain, air resistance, and spin for accurate modeling. \ud83c\udf0d 3. Practical Applications 3.1 Real-World Examples of Projectile Motion Projectile motion models are widely used to analyze and predict the behavior of objects launched through the air. Although idealized, the core concepts apply across multiple fields: \u26bd Sports Football : Calculating the arc of a long-range shot or optimizing a throw-in angle. Basketball : Predicting whether a jump shot will go in, based on release angle and velocity. Golf : Determining launch angles and spin for maximum driving distance. \ud83e\ude96 Artillery & Military Projectile Trajectories : A fundamental component in the design and deployment of rockets, mortars, and ballistic missiles. Targeting Algorithms : Simplified models used in early targeting, later refined with correction factors. \u26f2 Civil & Mechanical Engineering Water Fountains : Designing jets to achieve desired arcs and reach. Fire Hose Streams : Ensuring water reaches upper floors or targets accurately. \ud83c\udf0c Space and Astrophysics Planetary Landings : Parabolic descent approximations are used during initial planning phases. Escape Velocities : Initial modeling assumes projectile-style motion before introducing orbital dynamics. 3.2 Limitations of the Basic Model The idealized equations of projectile motion assume: Constant gravitational acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) No air resistance Flat, horizontal ground No rotation or curvature of the Earth Point-mass particles (no size or spin) These assumptions limit the accuracy of predictions in real scenarios. Here are the main factors not considered in the basic model: 3.3 Additional Real-World Factors 1. \ud83c\udf00 Air Resistance (Drag) Air resistance opposes the direction of motion and increases with velocity. Its presence results in: Shorter range : The projectile loses kinetic energy over time. Asymmetrical trajectory : The descent is steeper than the ascent. Terminal velocity : For downward motion, objects stop accelerating eventually. The drag force can be modeled as: $$ F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 $$ Where: - \\(C_d\\) : Drag coefficient - \\(\\rho\\) : Air density - \\(A\\) : Cross-sectional area - \\(v\\) : Instantaneous velocity Including air resistance requires solving a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations. 2. \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f Wind Wind can alter the projectile path significantly: - Headwind reduces range - Tailwind increases range - Crosswind introduces lateral deflection Wind must be modeled as an external velocity vector affecting the relative airspeed of the projectile. 3. \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Inclined or Curved Terrain Flat ground assumption fails in: - Mountainous terrain - Urban environments - Ramps and inclined launch pads When the landing surface is inclined at an angle \\(\\phi\\) , the effective range becomes geometry-dependent: $$ R_{\\text{inclined}} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2(\\theta - \\phi))}{g \\cos^2 \\phi} $$ Curved surfaces require even more complex treatment, often using polar or spherical coordinate systems. 4. \ud83e\udded Earth's Rotation (Coriolis Effect) For long-range projectiles (e.g., intercontinental artillery or rockets): - The Coriolis force due to Earth\u2019s rotation deflects trajectories. - Significant in military and aerospace engineering. 3.4 Summary Factor Effect on Motion Requires Complex Modeling? Air Resistance Reduces range, changes trajectory \u2705 Yes Wind Alters path, may drift laterally \u2705 Yes Terrain Geometry Affects landing height and distance \u2705 Yes Earth's Rotation Causes trajectory deviation \u2705 Yes While the basic projectile model provides a strong foundation, accurate prediction and engineering design require extending the model to account for these factors through numerical methods or simulation. # \u2705 Imports import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from math import radians, sin, cos, sqrt from ipywidgets import interact import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') # \u2705 Core Functions def compute_range(v0, theta_deg, g=9.81): theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g def compute_range_with_height(v0, theta_deg, h, g=9.81): theta_rad = radians(theta_deg) vy = v0 * sin(theta_rad) vx = v0 * cos(theta_rad) discriminant = vy**2 + 2 * g * h if discriminant < 0: return 0 t_total = (vy + sqrt(discriminant)) / g return vx * t_total # \u2705 Plot: Range vs. Angle (Ground Level) def plot_range_vs_angle(v0, g=9.81): angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 500) ranges = [compute_range(v0, theta, g) for theta in angles] plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5)) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f\"v\u2080 = {v0} m/s\") plt.title(\"Range vs. Launch Angle (Ground Level)\") plt.xlabel(\"Angle \u03b8 (degrees)\") plt.ylabel(\"Range R (meters)\") plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.show() # \u2705 Plot: Range vs. Angle (With Height) def plot_range_vs_angle_with_height(v0, h, g=9.81): angles = np.linspace(1, 89, 500) ranges = [compute_range_with_height(v0, theta, h, g) for theta in angles] plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5)) plt.plot(angles, ranges, color='green', label=f\"v\u2080 = {v0} m/s, height = {h} m\") plt.title(\"Range vs. Launch Angle (With Height)\") plt.xlabel(\"Angle \u03b8 (degrees)\") plt.ylabel(\"Range R (meters)\") plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.show() # \u2705 Plot: Multiple Trajectories def plot_trajectories(v0, h=0, g=9.81, angles_deg=[15, 30, 45, 60, 75]): plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for angle in angles_deg: theta = radians(angle) vx = v0 * cos(theta) vy = v0 * sin(theta) discriminant = vy**2 + 2 * g * h if discriminant < 0: continue t_flight = (vy + sqrt(discriminant)) / g t = np.linspace(0, t_flight, 500) x = vx * t y = h + vy * t - 0.5 * g * t**2 plt.plot(x, y, label=f\"{angle}\u00b0\") plt.title(\"Projectile Trajectories at Different Angles\") plt.xlabel(\"Horizontal Distance (m)\") plt.ylabel(\"Vertical Height (m)\") plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.show() # \u2705 Interactive Dashboard (Colab-compatible) @interact(v0=(10, 100, 5), h=(0, 50, 1), g=(5.0, 20.0, 0.1)) def update(v0=30, h=0, g=9.81): plot_range_vs_angle(v0, g) plot_range_vs_angle_with_height(v0, h, g) plot_trajectories(v0, h, g)","title":"1.
