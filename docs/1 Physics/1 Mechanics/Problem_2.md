# Theoretical Foundation: Forced Damped Pendulum

The dynamics of a **forced damped pendulum** can be captured by a second-order nonlinear differential equation that includes the effects of inertia, damping, restoring force (gravity), and external periodic driving force.

## General Equation of Motion

The standard form of the governing equation is:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin(\theta) = \Gamma \cos(\omega t)
$$

Where:

- $\theta(t)$ is the angular displacement.
- $\beta$ is the damping coefficient (frictional resistance).
- $\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$ is the natural frequency of the undriven, undamped pendulum.
- $\Gamma$ is the amplitude of the external driving torque.
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the driving force.

This equation is **nonlinear** due to the $\sin(\theta)$ term.

---

## Linearization for Small-Angle Approximation

For small angular displacements, where $\theta \ll 1$ (in radians), we can approximate:

$$
\sin(\theta) \approx \theta
$$

Substituting this into the equation yields a linear second-order nonhomogeneous ODE:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = \Gamma \cos(\omega t)
$$

This linearized form is more tractable analytically and is a classic model for studying resonance and damping in oscillatory systems.

---

## Analytical Solution to the Linearized Equation

The general solution to the linearized equation is the sum of the **homogeneous solution** and the **particular solution**.

### Homogeneous Equation:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = 0
$$

- This represents **free damped oscillations**.
- The solution depends on the damping ratio $\zeta = \frac{\beta}{2\omega_0}$.
- Possible cases:
  - Underdamped: $\zeta < 1$
  - Critically damped: $\zeta = 1$
  - Overdamped: $\zeta > 1$

### Particular Solution:

For the driving term $\Gamma \cos(\omega t)$, we assume a solution of the form:

$$
\theta_p(t) = A \cos(\omega t - \phi)
$$

Substituting into the equation, we find:

$$
A = \frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + \beta^2 \omega^2}}, \quad \tan(\phi) = \frac{\beta \omega}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}
$$

---

## Resonance

**Resonance** occurs when the amplitude $A$ of steady-state oscillation becomes maximal. This happens when the driving frequency $\omega$ approaches the system's **resonant frequency**.

For small damping ($\beta \ll 1$), the resonance condition approximates to:

$$
\omega_{\text{res}} \approx \omega_0
$$

At resonance, the system absorbs energy most efficiently from the external force, leading to large amplitude oscillations if not damped.

---

## Energy Transfer and Dissipation

- **Driving Force**: Injects energy into the system at a rate dependent on $\Gamma$ and $\omega$.
- **Damping Term** ($\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt}$): Continuously dissipates energy, converting mechanical energy into thermal energy.
- In the **steady-state**, energy input from the driver is balanced by energy loss from damping.

This interplay governs whether the pendulum settles into a periodic motion, undergoes resonance, or transitions into chaotic behavior when nonlinearity is reintroduced.
